3. sleep(long millis)  :- Pauses the thread for a specified time (in milliseconds).
4. join() :- Waits for the thread to die (i.e., finish execution).
5. join(long millis) :- Waits for the thread to die or timeout after specified milliseconds.
6. yield() :- Suggests that the current thread pause and allow other threads to execute.
7. interrupt() :- Interrupts the thread if it's sleeping, waiting, or otherwise blocked.
8. isAlive() :-	Checks if the thread is still running (not terminated).
10. isInterrupted() :- Checks if the thread has been interrupted.

 Thread Lifecycle States
 -----------------------------
Java threads go through these states:
- NEW: Thread is created but not started.
- RUNNABLE: Thread is ready to run or running.
- BLOCKED: Waiting to acquire a lock.
- WAITING: Waiting indefinitely for another thread.
- TIMED_WAITING: Waiting for a specified time.
- TERMINATED: Thread has finished execution
