C++:
    1)is cross platform and high level programmin language
    2)C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

    3)C++ gives a better performance than C language and as well as low level language.
    4)C++ is an object oriented programming language.
    5)C++ supports both procedural and object oriented programming language.
    6)C++ is used to create different types of applications, such as operating systems, video games, and so on.
C++ is case-sensitive: "cout" and "Cout" has different meaning.
C:
    1)is low level language

Difference Between c and c++:-
The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ supports classes and objects, while C does not.

#include <iostream> //it a header file which add the functionlity to programs [cout]
using namespace std;   //we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!"; //std::cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
cout << "Hello World!" << endl; printing the string and take new line for printing other statement
Both \n and endl are used to break lines. However, \n is most used.

But what is \n exactly?
The newline character (\n) is called an escape sequence, 
and it forces the cursor to change its position to the beginning of the next line on the screen. This results in a new line.

Escape Sequence	DescriptionTry 
\t	Creates a horizontal tab	
\\	Inserts a backslash character (\)	
\"	Inserts a double quote character "

C++ Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.

In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
bool - stores values with two states: true or false



Oops concept in c++
    inheritance: inheriting the property from parent to child class
    types:- 1)single
            2)Multiple
            3)Multi-level
            4)heirarchical
            5) Hybrid

Base class: where class actual defined the properties
Derived class: the  class which is deriving the property from Base class
