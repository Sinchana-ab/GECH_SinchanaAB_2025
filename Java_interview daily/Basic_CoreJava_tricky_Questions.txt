Core Java (Basic / Syntax / Keywords) Theory Trick Questions

-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. What is the default value of local variables?

Ans: They don’t have a default value. You must initialize them before use.

Instance variables do have defaults.

--

2. static variable and local variable lifetime or scope?.
ans:- 

i)Local varaibale:-

Definition: Declared inside a method, constructor, or block.

Lifetime: Created when method is called, destroyed when method ends.

Scope: Only within that method/block.

Default value: No default value — must be initialized before use.

Cannot be static.

---

ii)Static Variable (Class Variable)

Definition: Declared inside a class but outside any method, using the static keyword.

Lifetime: Created when the class is loaded, destroyed when program ends.

Scope: Shared across all objects of the class.

Has a default value if not initialized (e.g., 0 for int, null for objects).

---

2. Can a Java file have multiple public classes?

Ans: No. Only one public class per file, and file name must match that public class name.

---

3. Can main() method be private or protected?

Ans: Yes, it compiles and runs, but JVM looks for public static void main(String[] args) as the entry point.
If not found, it throws NoSuchMethodError.

---

4. Can we run a Java program without main() method?

Old trick: Before Java 7, static blocks could run without main. Now, main is mandatory.
static{
syso("hello world");
system.exit(0);
}

---

5. What is the default value of an uninitialized String instance variable?

Ans: null.

---

6. Can static variables be local to a method?

Ans: No, static variables are always class-level. Local variables cannot be static.

---

7. Can we declare a variable without specifying its type?

Ans: No in normal Java, but yes using var (Java 10+) for local variables — still strongly typed by compiler.

---

8. Can we use a reserved keyword as a variable name?

Ans: No. But you can use keywords in different case (Java is case-sensitive).

---

9. Can a Java class be both final and abstract?

Ans: No, final means cannot be extended, abstract means must be extended.

---

10. What is the size of int in Java?

Ans: Always 4 bytes, regardless of OS (Java is platform-independent in data type size).

---

11. Can we assign a double value to an int variable without casting?

Ans: No — it causes a compile error (possible loss of precision).

---

12. Can we declare an array of size zero in Java?

Ans: Yes. Example: int[] arr = new int[0]; is valid.

---

13. What happens if we divide an integer by zero?

Ans: Throws ArithmeticException. But if we divide a floating-point number by zero, it returns Infinity or NaN.

---

14. Can we use underscores in numeric literals?

Ans: Yes (Java 7+), e.g., int num = 1_000_000;
But not at start/end or next to decimal point.

---

15. Is null a keyword in Java?

Ans: No, null is a literal, like true and false.

---

16. Can a Java program have two classes with the same name in the same package?

Ans: No, names must be unique in the same package.

---

17. Can we use return in void methods?

Ans: Yes, but without a value — just return;.

---

18. Can we write public static void main(String args[]) without String[]?

Ans: No, but the brackets can be after the variable: String args[].

---

19. Can we reassign a final variable?

Ans: No — once assigned, cannot change. But for final reference variables, object’s internal state can change.

---

20. Can Java use multiple inheritance of classes?

Ans: No, only via interfaces (this is more syntax rule than OOP).
